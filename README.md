# Basic Examples of SQLAlchemy ORM

This Github repository is a collection of simple examples that demonstrate how to use SQLAlchemy ORM, a powerful and flexible tool for working with databases in Python. SQLAlchemy ORM provides a high-level interface for creating and manipulating database objects using Python code, rather than SQL statements. This makes it easier to work with databases and reduces the amount of boilerplate code required for database operations.

The examples in this repository cover a range of basic SQLAlchemy ORM operations, including:

* Creating tables
* Inserting data
* Querying data
* Updating data

These examples are designed to be easy to follow and understand, even for those who are new to SQLAlchemy ORM or Python in general.

The examples include code snippets for:

* Creating models (i.e., Python classes that represent database tables)
* Defining relationships between models
* Querying data using filters and joins
* Updating records

Additionally, the examples cover some advanced topics such as database transactions and handling errors.

Whether you're new to SQLAlchemy ORM or just looking for a refresher, this repository provides a great starting point for learning the basics. Feel free to fork the repository and modify the code to suit your needs. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contribute to the repository.
